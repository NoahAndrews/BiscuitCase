BiscuitCase is a fictional restaurant that sells both hot food and non-perishable items.
For a school project, I am writing two apps based around an on-device SQLite database. One app will allow customers to purchase things listed in the database, and the other will allow the database to be managed.
This project is an offshoot of my earlier HappyBurger project.
